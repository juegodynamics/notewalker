Following a physical examination and imaging studies, the patient was diagnosed with an intraabdominal cystic mass, with no presence of malignancy. During surgery, it was found that the patient had torsion in her left adnexa, and a necrotic ovary was discovered. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed along with an incidental appendectomy. An oophoropexy was carried out on her right ovary, with absorbable suture at the level of the pelvic brim of the sidewall of her abdomen after draining peripheral cysts. A pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a necrotic ovary, with cysts smaller than 1 cm on her contralateral ovary, which were aspirated during surgery. The postoperative period showed no signs of wound infections or peritonitis, and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day.</div>"
