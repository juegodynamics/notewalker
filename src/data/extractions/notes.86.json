The patient had a history of spontaneous miscarriage and a prior Caesarian section with a normal course of parturition. She underwent cell-free fetal DNA testing, which showed a low risk for aneuploidy. The karyotype test performed after her miscarriage was normal. Previous ultrasound evaluations showed conflicting results with isolated aortic arch anomaly, coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal defect, and minor dilations.\n\nThe patient underwent fetal echocardiography, which revealed mild cardiomegaly with a left deviated heart axis of 72 degrees, a small membranous ventricular septal defect, and ductal aortic coarctation. An aneurysmal structure measuring 1.63/1.25/1.16 cm with turbulent Doppler flow was identified, located above the emergence of the pulmonary trunk and continued by a dilated vascular structure that bifurcates in the cervical region, which is connected to the left pulmonary artery. The patient requested termination of the pregnancy by drug-induced abortion due to the complexity of cardiovascular malformations.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nFetal cardiac malformation with aortic arch anomaly, coarctation of the aorta, membranous ventricular septal defect, ductal aortic coarctation, and dilated left subclavian and pulmonary arteries.\n\nHospital Course Summary:\nThe patient presented with multiple complex fetal cardiac malformations, confirmed by fetal echocardiography. Due to the severity and complexity of the malformations, the patient elected to terminate the pregnancy by drug-induced abortion. Further investigations revealed significant dilation of the venous system of the neck and mediastinum, including the dilated left subclavian and pulmonary arteries. After hands-on dissection of the fetus, no additional complications were noted. The patient was discharged in stable condition with appropriate discharge instructions and follow-up recommendations."
