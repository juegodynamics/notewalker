On admission, he had a Glasgow Coma scale score of 15 and was hemodynamically stable. Imaging studies revealed nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum and trace pneumoperitoneum with no evidence of extravasation of oral contrast.\n\nBased on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma, the patient was taken to the operating room. During exploratory laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was found, and a segmental section of the diseased portion of the colon was taken and sent to pathology.\n\nPathology results revealed multiple enlarged cystic nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in the bowel wall. Radiologic studies were reviewed by a panel of abdominal radiologists, who suggested that the proximity of the pneumoperitoneum to the pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis suggested that the pneumoperitoneum may have been caused by incidental atraumatic or traumatic rupture of the cysts, but they could not rule out bowel perforation based on imaging alone.\n\nThe patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was transferred to an acute care facility of equal acuity for further medical management as per the patient’s health insurance request.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\nThe patient’s condition was treated in a prompt and timely manner, and he is stable at the time of discharge. The patient will follow up with his primary care physician for a postoperative checkup and discuss any further medical management if required.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:\n\nThe patient is stable at the time of discharge and will continue to follow up with his primary care physicians as recommended. Discharge instructions, including activity limitations and follow-up appointments, have been provided to the patient.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n\n[N/A]\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n\nBlunt chest and abdominal trauma, with the presence of pneumoperitoneum and multiple enlarged cystic nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in the bowel wall."
