The patient had a history of seawater contact and noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears. As the condition progressed, the drainage from the left ear vanished and the drainage from the right ear increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris. The ear canal became obstructed by the thick excretion, which caused the patient to experience mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and a sensation of ear fullness. The patient did not use any medications to relieve symptoms, but instead removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, which resulted in a return to normal hearing and relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal causing the symptoms to reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xiâ€™an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve. The discharge from the right ear gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018, when a low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution was used to rinse the right ear canal at a local hospital.</p><p>The patient denied any history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition.</p><p>The patient underwent audiometric and otoscopic examinations as well as radiological examinations using computed tomography imaging to examine the temporal bone. The exudate was collected from his right ear using a sterile swab and was transferred to the clinical microbiology laboratory for examination.</p><p>The exudate from the right ear was analyzed by the clinical microbiology laboratory.
