It was noted from histopathology reports that there was chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with associated histiocytes and granulation tissue, further supporting the diagnosis of chronic appendicitis.\n\nTreatment:\nLaparoscopic appendectomy was performed on [Name]. The appendix was identified and found to be chronically scarred and chronically inflamed in appearance. The mesoappendix was taken down with Sonicision, the base transected with Endo-GIA, and delivered from the peritoneal cavity in an Endobag and sent to pathology.\n\nDischarge Condition:\n[Name] was discharged home on the same day as his procedure with no complaints.\n\nInstructions:\nPlease follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) in the coming days to ensure that there has been complete resolution of symptoms.\n\nSigned,\n[Doctor's name]."
