On admission, the patient required 4 L/min of oxygen due to rapid shallow breathing at rest and severe breathlessness during minor physical activity. The initial physical therapy focused on educating the patient on dyspnea-relieving positions, mobilization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises. However, with time, the patient's anxiety-induced dyspnea became an issue, leading to the modification of therapy to relieve his dyspnea. The patient positively responded to the therapy, evidenced by a reduction in respiratory rate from 30 to 22 breaths/min and an increase in oxygen saturation from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen. Over the next few days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate gradually, and the patient regained his self-confidence. The therapy was eventually shifted to walking and strength training, and the patient was able to walk for 350m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before discharge.</div>"
