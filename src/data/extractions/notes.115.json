        "description": "Case 2 is an 8-year-old male child who presented to the hospital with chief complaints of pain in the anterior maxilla following exposure to cold water. The patient had a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth at the age of one year, with composite resin repair of a fracture in the crown of the upper right primary central incisor. Physical examination revealed an abnormal position of the upper right permanent central incisor and clouding of the labial surface, which were likely due to trauma to the primary teeth. The VAS value was 6 for cold water and 7.5 for air blowing.",
