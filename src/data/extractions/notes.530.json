        "valueString": "The patient presented to our Oral Surgery Clinic with recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek. He had previously undergone bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in a local hospital. During the operation, an orthodontic appliance was dislodged into his right cheek, which was found during the postoperative period. The appliance was left in-situ with continuous clinical observation due to the absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions. After undergoing examination and radiography, a sinus track was found which was suspected to originate from the dislodged orthodontic appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. After further investigation through exploration of the site under general anesthesia, the dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap, which was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. A titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone below the removed appliance. Due to the site being infected, the plate and screws were removed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was informed of his progress."
