High-output unipolar pacing from the PHB lead resulted in a narrow QRS complex with resolution of the conduction abnormalities. However, intracardiac EGMs on the octapolar catheter revealed that the recorded His-bundle potential was not captured during PHB lead pacing. The octapolar catheter was advanced beyond the PHB lead tip to ensure there was not capture of the distal His bundle. Pacing at lower outputs resulted in non-selective His capture."
