The snake was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal intussusception and a surgical procedure was recommended. After the surgery, the snake was treated with medications and discharged the following day. The snake was later diagnosed with chronic proliferative gastritis due to Cryptosporidium sp. The snake was treated and discharged with instructions to follow up with the veterinarian regularly. At 15 months after surgery, the snake was found deceased in its enclosure.</div>"
