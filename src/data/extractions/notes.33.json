On physical examination, marked tenderness of the right sternoclavicular joint was noted. Initial laboratory investigations and chest X-rays were unremarkable, although MRI revealed subchondral bone marrow edema and enhancement involving the medial end of the right clavicle. In addition, mild effusion of the right sternoclavicular joint and surrounding soft-tissue edema was also seen. Given the patient's radiological and clinical findings, suspicion of SAPHO syndrome was raised. He was prescribed paracetamol and NSAIDs, which led to a remarkable improvement in his symptoms."
