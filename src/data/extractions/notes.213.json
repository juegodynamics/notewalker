Her father was visually impaired, and the daughter was the main caregiver. The home care staff initially had difficulty contacting and communicating with her as she often focused on household tasks such as dishwashing. After the diagnosis of ASD was disclosed, the patient received consultation and social skill training at an outpatient clinic to improve her communication, scheduling, and caregiving abilities. Inappropriate behavior decreased following explanations and making communication rules with the patient. The patient's mother's condition worsened, and she required opioids for pain control. The patient was able to communicate with the home care staff effectively and provide appropriate care during this time. Unfortunately, the patient's mother passed away at home.</div>"
