Hence, a mechanical glide-path with Proglider at working length was performed using an endodontic engine followed by root canal preparation with ProTaper Next X1 and X2 and manual 20/02-25/02 NiTi hand file sliding down the glide path up to working length. The buccal canal was treated with a modern step-down technique without initial manual scouting. The initial mechanical preflaring was performed at first with Proglider until above the first root canal curvature, and then the apical scouting, glide path and shaping was done with ProTaper Next X1, X2 and manual 20/02-25/02 NiTi hand file sliding down the glide path up to working length, which was determined using an electronic apex locator. After shaping, both sites were filled with Thermafil 25 after 3D cleaning of the root canal system."
