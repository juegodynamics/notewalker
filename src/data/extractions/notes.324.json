The patient had initially noticed a painless mass in her right maxillary premolar region in 2002, but she did not seek any treatment for it. She was referred to us for examination and treatment due to difficulty in performing tracheal intubation for surgery of sigmoid colon cancer at another hospital. After performing several tests, the patient was diagnosed with peripheral ossifying fibroma with squamous cell carcinoma. We suspected a benign gingival tumor in the right maxillary premolar region, which was confirmed by a biopsy. Later, tumorectomy was performed under general anesthesia to remove the tumor, including the surrounding tissue. One week after surgery, the wound was covered with an oral appliance for protection. The microscopic findings of the surgically removed tumor were similar to those of the biopsy specimen. The tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells that were proliferating with collagenous fiber, and scattered bone formation was also observed. The epithelial component of the tumor was considered to be well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. No signs of local recurrence or metastasis have been observed during follow-up."
