The patient underwent wedge resection of these lesions a month later. Gross examination of the surgical specimens revealed an intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made.\n\nGenetic testing of the tumor tissue was performed, which revealed a number of somatic mutations in each entity. The adenocarcinoma and carcinoid components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF, NF1, STK11, and AKT2 genes. Further, four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2, CDK6, and SMARCA4 genes in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component. A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules, which lacked those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS and NOTCH1 genes.\n\nDue to ROS1 positivity observed in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia, the patient started crizotinib in November 2020. The patient is still receiving the treatment, and the current status of the disease is stable.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nThe patient requires regular medical follow-up and evaluation to monitor the status of the disease. The patient is advised to follow up with the oncologist at regular intervals and take the prescribed medication as instructed. The patient should also maintain good health practices, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction.\n\nConclusion:\nThe discharge summary indicates that the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent wedge resection of two lung lesions. The final diagnosis was \"combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid.\" The genetic analysis revealed different somatic mutations in the different tumor entities. The patient started crizotinib due to ROS1 positivity, and the current status of the disease is stable. The patient is advised to follow medical instructions and maintain good health practices."
