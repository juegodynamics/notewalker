The patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with PML-RARα.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient's laboratory data upon admission showed leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an abnormal coagulation profile. The patient received treatment with ATRA and idarubicin, and later ATO infusion was initiated. However, the patient developed complete AV block with a heart rate (HR) of 40-50 bpm during ATO infusion, and treatment was immediately discontinued. The patient developed bilateral pulmonary edema and signs of cardiac tamponade, and a temporary pacemaker was inserted. After stopping ATRA for three doses, the patient's HR partially recovered, and ATRA was rechallenged. However, the patient developed sinus bradycardia with a first-degree AV block and diffuse ST elevation, and arta treatment was delayed. A temporary pacemaker was removed after the patient's condition stabilized, and ATRA was resumed with gradually increasing dosage. The patient achieved complete molecular remission and received three cycles of consolidation with ATRA-based chemotherapy before being discharged.\n\nDiagnosis:\nThe patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with PML-RARα.\n\nTreatment:\nATRA and idarubicin were administered initially, and later ATO infusion was initiated before being discontinued due to complications. The patient received a temporary pacemaker and steroid treatment was switched to dexamethasone. After discontinuing ATRA, the patient's pacemaker was removed, and ATRA was resumed with gradually increasing dosage.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nThe patient achieved complete molecular remission and received three cycles of consolidation with ATRA-based chemotherapy. The patient was discharged in stable condition.\n\nPlan:\nThe patient will be followed up regularly to monitor for any potential complications or recurrence of disease."
