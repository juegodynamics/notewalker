The pain intensity was marked at 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), accompanied by severe hypersensitivity and allodynia at the left fingers, wrist, and hand. The pain caused a reduction in the strength of the left wrist and hand, which made a handshake impossible for the patient. She reported swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain interfered with her regular attendance at school and caused social withdrawal phenomena. The patient reported the onset of pain three months prior to the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist. She had taken NSAIDs but did not respond to the drug. Diagnostic tests were negative, including X-ray, Doppler ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. During the first visit, the patient was administered oral Tramadol to reduce musculoskeletal pain."

In the third session, the girl reported unbearable pain in the affected limb due to the insertion and maintenance of needles in the area. Abdominal acupuncture was suggested, and the points chosen were CV 4, CV 12, CV 16, CV 17, ST 24, and KI 17, with appropriate needles and maintaining the same interspeed and time of stimulation. The needles were inserted to a depth of 0.2 cun. The combination of these points was aimed at re-establishing the correct circulation of qi. Auriculotherapy was also associated with Vaccaria seeds on the Wrist, Hand, and Shenmen points, with the recommendation to stimulate them at home for 10 min, four times a day until the next session. Following eight sessions (two months) of abdominal acupuncture, the patient reported complete disappearance of the pain. During follow-ups at three months, six months, and one year, the patient reported complete remission of symptoms, with constant values of NRS equal to 0. The reduction in pain allowed the patient to resume normal school attendance and to resume a life of normal, balanced relationships."
