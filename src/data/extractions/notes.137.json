              "data": "Hospital Course: Admission Date: [Date] Discharge Date: [Date] Patient: [Name] History and Presenting Problem: This 5-year-old boy with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), joint hyperlaxity, and morphogenetic anomalies. The patient’s mother had a history of epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures, photosensitivity, and moderate elevation in serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels following physical exercise. Assessment and Findings: The patient was born from non-consanguineous parents after an uneventful dizygotic twin pregnancy. He had delayed milestones and showed a lack of eye contact, visual tracking, and social interest from early on. EEG showed focal spikes over the frontal region and the left temporal region and generalized spike-and-wave complexes during sleep. A brain MRI showed normal results. Muscular dystrophy was confirmed through genetic analysis of the dystrophin gene which detected the deletion of exons 46-51 of the gene. The child presented with severe developmental delays and autistic features, including poor eye contact, absence of protodeclarative pointing, attention deficit, and inadequate social-communicative abilities. Joint hyperlaxity and peculiar facial traits were noted, including a high forehead, epicanthic folds, deep-set eyes, an elongated face, and large ears. Following array-CGH analysis and FMR1 molecular analysis, the comorbidity with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) was confirmed. Treatment and Course: The patient received a rehabilitation program that showed a slight improvement, especially in his motor skills. The patient was discharged to continue therapy as an outpatient. The family was referred to genetic counseling. Discharge Diagnoses: 1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy 2. Intellectual disability 3. Autism spectrum disorder 4. Joint hyperlaxity 5. Morphogenetic anomalies 6. Fragile X syndrome Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged in stable condition with continued symptoms and ongoing medical needs. Discharge Medications: N/A Follow-Up: Follow-up appointments with the rehabilitation program and genetic counseling were scheduled."
