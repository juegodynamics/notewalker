On physical examination, he was an overweight Caucasian male with symmetrical breasts. On palpation, there was a bilateral pseudogynaecomastia with a smooth, ill-defined left breast thickening, especially at the union of the outer quadrants. With applied pressure, a minimal clear stream of discharge fluid was elicited from the left nipple and was felt to be localized to a single duct.\n\nMedical Condition:\nPatient was diagnosed with an intraductal papilloma (IP) with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and a single focus of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) solid-cribriform type, which was surgically removed by a left subcutaneous nipple-sparing mastectomy without sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient did not undergo axillary dissection and was administered tamoxifen as approved adjuvant hormone treatment for men with ER-positive early stage breast cancer.\n\nFollow-up:\nThe patient was noted to be doing well 6 months post-operatively and is still on follow-up at the time of writing.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nIntraductal papilloma (IP) with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and a single focus of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) solid-cribriform type.\n\nRecommendations:\nFollow-up with the multidisciplinary team for further management.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nStable.\n\nDischarge Medication:\nN/A.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nN/A.\n\nSigned,\n[Doctor's Name], MD."
