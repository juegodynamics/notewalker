She was diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) due to idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination. The patient was treated with sodium correction and pulse methylprednisolone and discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.\n\nOne year later, the patient presented to the neurology department with generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs, which made her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Clinical examination revealed pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia.

Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone and referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.\n\nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n\nFollow-Up Appointments:\nThe patient was referred to a rheumatologist for further management.\n\nInstructions:\nThe patient should follow-up with her rheumatologist. The patient should continue taking oral potassium and sodium bicarbonate as prescribed. The patient should maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n1.
