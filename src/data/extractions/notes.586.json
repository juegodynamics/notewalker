Subsequent physical examination, echocardiography, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm, severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic coarctation. A multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two-staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful, and the decision was then made to proceed to a single-stage surgical approach to treat both lesions. Following induction of anesthesia, the patient underwent a right infraclavicular and right groin incision. The aortic root, valve, and ascending aorta were excised, and the coronary ostia were noted to be significantly displaced. Root replacement was performed with a 25 mm biological valved-conduit, and an end-to-side anastomosis was fashioned between the 20 mm extra-cardiac graft (attached to the descending thoracic aorta) and the ascending portion of the valved-conduit. Following rewarming and de-airing, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient remained in ICU for less than 48 hours and made excellent progress on the ward. At 3 months follow up the patient underwent a repeat CTA scan which showed complete patency in the extra-anatomical graft and resolution of the collateral arterial network. Diagnoses: - Aortic root aneurysm - Severe aortic regurgitation - Severe aortic coarctation Procedures: - Surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm - Root replacement - End-to-side anastomosis Consultations: - Multidisciplinary team meeting Condition at Discharge: The patient was discharged on 8th postoperatively neurologically intact and independent. Minimal anti-hypertensives were required. Follow-Up Plans: The patient will continue to follow-up with their primary care provider for further management and monitoring."
