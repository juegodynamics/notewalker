DWI showed slightly hyperintense signal on isotropic trace image and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map revealed slightly restricted diffusion in the mass. There was a small, non-enhancing hemorrhagic fluid collection present between the mass and the tympanic membrane. Middle and internal ear structures were normal on both MRI and temporal CT images."
